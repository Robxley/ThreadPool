# Thread pool c++ 11

A simple C++11 Thread Pool implementation supporting the task interlock.

# Philosophy

1. A task is added to the pool thread.           
2 .The pool thread is running on the task list.   
3 .The result of a task is needed. If the task has not been completed or has not been started by the thread pool, 
the task is executed locally and removed from the thread pool.

The first arrived on the task, runs the task !

# Exemple :

void main()
{
	auto & pool = ThreadPool::singleton(2);

	auto thA = pool.enqueue([&pool]
	{
		auto thA_1 = pool.enqueue([]{
		    // Do something awesome!
		});
		auto thA_2 = pool.enqueue([]{
		    // Do something crasy!
		});

		thA_1.join();
		thA_2.join();
	});
	
	auto thB = pool.enqueue([&pool]
	{

		auto thB_1 = pool.enqueue([] {
      // your dream here
		});

		auto thB_2 = pool.enqueue([] {
      // something
		});

		thB_1.join();
		thB_2.join();
	});


	thB.join();
	thA.join();
}
